# Content & SEO Guidelines for Bangla Tools HUB

This document outlines the strategy for creating high-quality, SEO-optimized content for the website. These rules apply to both tool pages (`.md` files in `src/content/tools`) and blog posts (`.md` files in `src/content/blog`).

## Core Principles

1.  **Language:** All content must be written **exclusively in Bengali (বাংলা)**. No foreign languages should be used unless absolutely necessary (e.g., brand names).
2.  **Target Audience:** The primary audience is Bengali speakers in India and Bangladesh, but the content should be clear enough for a global audience.
3.  **Content Goal:** To provide immense value to the user, answer their questions thoroughly, and establish the website as an authority in the niche of Bangla tools.

## Content Requirements

### 1. Length & Depth
*   **Minimum Word Count: 3000+ words.** This is a strict requirement to avoid "thin content" issues with Google AdSense and to rank higher in search results.
*   **Rich Content:** The content must be comprehensive and in-depth. It should cover the topic from all possible angles, including tutorials, examples, FAQs, and related information.

### 2. Originality
*   **100% Plagiarism-Free:** All content must be original. Use plagiarism checkers to ensure uniqueness.
*   **AI-Detection Free:** While AI can be used for research and brainstorming, the final text must be human-written or heavily edited to pass AI detection tools. The tone should be natural and helpful.

### 3. Readability & Formatting
*   **Simple Language:** Use clear, simple, and beautiful Bengali that is easy for everyone to understand. Avoid overly technical jargon.
*   **Paragraphs:** Keep paragraphs short (2-4 sentences) for better readability on both desktop and mobile.
*   **Headings:** Use a clear heading structure.
    *   **H1:** Only one H1 per page (this is the main title from the frontmatter).
    *   **H2, H3, H4:** Use subheadings to break down the content into logical sections. Keywords should be naturally included in these headings.
*   **Bold Text:** Use **bold** formatting to highlight important keywords and key phrases within the paragraphs.

    *   **Body Content:** Keywords should be distributed naturally throughout the article.
