    excerpt: 'Discover why Unicode is the gold standard for Bengali content and how it impacts SEO, accessibility, and user experience.',
    content: 'The digital world speaks in code, and for the Bangla language, Unicode is the universal translator. Before Unicode, various proprietary fonts like Bijoy made it difficult to share and display Bengali text consistently across different computers and websites. This often resulted in garbled text, known as "font breaking". Unicode solves this by assigning a unique code to every character, ensuring that "à¦•" is always "à¦•", no matter the device or platform. For content creators, using Unicode is crucial for Search Engine Optimization (SEO), as search engines can easily read and index the text. It also makes content accessible to screen readers for visually impaired users. Our **Bangla Unicode Converter** is the perfect tool to modernize your old content.',
